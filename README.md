Automated driving system promises a safe, comfortable and efficient driving system, ADS (Automated Driving System) divides the task of automated driving into subcategories and employs array of sensors and algorithms on various modules. The main emphasis of the proposed project is the simplicity and fast computation capability so that it can be embedded in affordable CPUs. The proposed technique is mainly a pipeline of computer vision algorithms to have a perception of the surrounding environment. The core perception tasks are Lane Detection and Object Detection. The whole pipeline performance is also tested and evaluated on real videos and images. The evaluation of the proposed technique shows that it reliably detects the pedestrians, traffic signs and tracks road boundaries under various conditions. Computer vision techniques are the main tools that provide the capabilities of sensing the surrounding environment for the detection, identification, and tracking of road lane-lines. The detection of lanes consists mainly of the finding of specific patterns/features such as the lane markings (colored segments) on painted roads surfaces. Such kind of specification streamlines or guides the process of lane detection.
